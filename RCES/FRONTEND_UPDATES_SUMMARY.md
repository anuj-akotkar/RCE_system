# Frontend Updates for Judge0 Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the frontend changes required to integrate with the updated backend that now uses Judge0 for code execution and evaluation.

## Backend Changes Summary
- **Judge0 Integration**: Code execution now uses Judge0 API at `localhost:2358`
- **Enhanced Submission System**: Detailed execution results with time, memory, and test case information
- **Full Code Template System**: Backend uses boilerplate templates for complete code execution
- **Improved API Responses**: More detailed error handling and status reporting

## Frontend Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Service (`src/services/operations/codeAPI.js`)
- **Modified `runCode` function**: Now requires `questionId` instead of `input`
- **Enhanced `submitCode` function**: Better response handling and success messages
- **Added new functions**:
  - `getSubmissionsByQuestion(questionId)`: Fetch all submissions for a question
  - `getSubmissionById(submissionId)`: Get detailed submission information
- **Improved error handling**: Better error messages and toast notifications

### 2. Enhanced Output Panel (`src/components/Core/ViewContest/OutputPanel.jsx`)
- **Complete redesign** to handle new Judge0 response structure
- **Sample Test Cases Section**: Displays results from running code with sample inputs
- **Submission Results Section**: Shows detailed submission information including:
  - Overall status (Accepted/Wrong Answer/Runtime Error)
  - Execution time and memory usage
  - Test case pass/fail count
  - Submission ID
- **Test Case Details**: Expandable section showing:
  - Individual test case results
  - Expected vs actual output
  - Execution time and memory per test case
  - Error messages if any
- **Improved styling**: Better color coding and visual hierarchy

### 3. Updated TakeContest Component (`src/components/Core/ViewContest/TakeContest.jsx`)
- **Removed direct API calls**: Now uses service functions from `codeAPI.js`
- **Enhanced error handling**: Better error messages and state management
- **Improved parameter passing**: Correctly passes `questionId` to API functions
- **Added validation**: Checks if question is selected before API calls

### 4. New Submission History Component (`src/components/Core/ViewContest/SubmissionHistory.jsx`)
- **Complete submission history**: View all past submissions for a question
- **Two-panel layout**:
  - Left panel: List of submissions with summary information
  - Right panel: Detailed view of selected submission
- **Features**:
  - Submission status and metadata
  - Code viewer with syntax highlighting
  - Detailed test case results
  - Execution time and memory usage
  - Error messages and status information
- **Modal interface**: Full-screen overlay for better user experience

### 5. Enhanced Question Panel (`src/components/Core/ViewContest/QuestionPanel.jsx`)
- **Added "View Submissions" button**: Quick access to submission history
- **Integrated submission history modal**: Seamless user experience
- **Maintained existing functionality**: Question selection and display

## New Features Added

### 1. Detailed Execution Metrics
- **Execution Time**: Per test case and total execution time
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption tracking
- **Status Information**: Detailed status for each test case

### 2. Enhanced Test Case Results
- **Individual Test Case Analysis**: See which specific test cases pass/fail
- **Expected vs Actual Output**: Clear comparison of outputs
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages for failed executions

### 3. Submission History
- **Complete History**: All past submissions for each question
- **Detailed Analysis**: Code review and performance metrics
- **Status Tracking**: Track improvement over time

### 4. Improved User Experience
- **Better Visual Feedback**: Color-coded results and status indicators
- **Loading States**: Clear loading indicators for better UX
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery

## API Endpoint Changes
The frontend now correctly uses:
- `POST /api/v1/code/run` - For running sample test cases
- `POST /api/v1/code/submit` - For full submission evaluation
- `GET /api/v1/code/question/:questionId` - For fetching submissions by question
- `GET /api/v1/code/:submissionId` - For fetching individual submission details

## Response Structure Changes

### Sample Run Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": [
    {
      "input": "test input",
      "expectedOutput": "expected",
      "output": "actual output",
      "passed": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Submission Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "submission": {
    "id": "submission_id",
    "status": "Accepted",
    "passed": true,
    "passedTests": 5,
    "totalTests": 5,
    "totalExecutionTime": "0.045",
    "maxMemory": 1024,
    "results": [
      {
        "testCase": 1,
        "input": "test input",
        "expectedOutput": "expected",
        "actualOutput": "actual",
        "passed": true,
        "executionTime": 0.009,
        "memory": 512,
        "status": "Accepted"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Testing Requirements
1. **Run Code Feature**: Test with various programming languages
2. **Submit Code Feature**: Test with both passing and failing submissions
3. **Submission History**: Verify all submissions are properly displayed
4. **Error Handling**: Test network failures and invalid inputs
5. **Performance**: Ensure UI remains responsive during code execution

## Dependencies
All required dependencies are already present in the project:
- React 19.1.0
- @monaco-editor/react for code editing
- react-hot-toast for notifications
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Notes
- All changes are backward compatible
- The frontend gracefully handles both old and new response formats
- Error handling has been significantly improved
- The UI is now more informative and user-friendly
